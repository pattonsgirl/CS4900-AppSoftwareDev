# Module Flow

1. Information / resource collection
    - define what students need to have read / watched BEFOREHAND
    - define what are additional resources of interest (not required)
    - Students requested BOTH a readable / text resource AND a video resource *if possible* to support multiple types of learning
2. Topic delivery
    - Assume the student have done required reading / watching ahead of class
      - Informal pop quiz?  Discussion based?
      - We can quiz the students via the LMS - must have questions two weeks before needed
    - Utilize WorkOrder Pro for demos & examples IN CLASS (do not assign homework that builds towards WorkOrder Pro)
    - Give time to review / allow discussion on group project taskings
    - Provide slides / notes to students BEFORE class
        - Upload to course material repository
        - Email to Kayleigh
3. Homework Assignments
    - To be completed INDIVIDUALLY.  Will focus on progressing group project
    - Assignments will be brought to class for group discussion time / module instructor feedback
    - Make assignments small (1-2 hours) between Tuesday & Thursday.  Longer / more time consuming assignments over weekends
4. Group Project Assignments
    - Teams put together collection of completed taskings
    - TYPICALLY due 1 week after module completion
    - 0 points for student if student on team has no git history in repo
5. Feedback / Grading
    - Students work exists in GitHub repos
    - Homework
      - students must create at least one issue noting something their group liked or needed to be improved on during feedback time
      - instructors check in that homework taskings were completed, award point score
    - Group project
      - score taskings that need to be completed
      - leave feedback on improvements / advice / positive notes on progress so far 
    - Module intructors leave SCORE and FEEDBACK in GitHub Issues in repository

## Getting Granular

Repository organization:
- 1 group work repository - PUBLIC
  - Should there only be one?  Or one for each project component?
- module repositories for homework assignments? - PUBLIC (to enable team sharing later)

    - Do this only if a good quick reference DOES NOT exist for your module - otherwise organize a resource page that points students to examples.  Don't reinvent documentation ;)
