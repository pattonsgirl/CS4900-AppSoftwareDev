# Response to Feedback - UNIT NAME

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to simulate the continued development of elements of your team's group project based on feedback to your group project deliverables.

## Description

This assignment will be posted once feedback has been delivered to your group project requirements within each module.

Once feedback has been posted, your team will have three days to read through the feedback and request clarifications.  Your team will make GitHub Issues - an expected minimum of two - based on this feedback.  Issue scope:
- failure to implement a component (needed additional time for delivery)
- update / change based on feedback
- improvement based on feedback

Teams will then have one week to resolve the posted issues.

Each issue created from the group project feedback must provide later commentary - by your team - on how and where (likely in terms of files) the issue was resolved or how progress has been made.

## Deliverables

A **minimum** of two Issues created in the group project repository in response to feedback from the unit's group project deleverables.

Each Issue must have a follow up post regarding how the issue has been resolved / progress made.
