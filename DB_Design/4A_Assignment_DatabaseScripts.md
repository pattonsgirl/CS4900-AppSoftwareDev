## Description

The intent is to learn about physical databases and build one using your group projectâ€™s theme.

1. In your HOMEWORK repository, create a folder named `DatabaseDesign`, then create a file named `DB-Assignment-4.md`.
2. Watch the required videos or read the required articles (listed in the [4R_PreWork_DatabaseScripts.md](4R_PreWork_DatabaseScripts.md) file)
3. Write a description of the following common physical database concepts:
	- What information should be included in a create table statement
	- What are database constraints and what are the benefits of them
	- Ways to insert data
	- What are database roles and what are they used for
	- Different type of users
4. Link to your GROUP physical model
5. Create scripts for your physical database for your group project theme
	- Your team may distribute the work - as long as **you** create a **minimum of one** table initialization script
	- [Example scripts for initializing Mr. Fix It](https://github.com/pattonsgirl/CS4900-AppSoftwareDev/tree/main/DB_Design/Database%20Scripts)
7. Provide descriptions in your scripts in comments.

In the 9/30 class session, your physical database scripts will undergo your group peer review to collaborate and agree on common group physical database scripts to be used ahead of the next assignment due 10/2.
