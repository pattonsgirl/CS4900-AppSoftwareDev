# Group Assignment - Conceptual Model

In your GROUP repository, create a folder called `Database`

As a GROUP, finalize a conceptual model.  Upload a digital copy of the conceptual model to the GROUP repository. 

You will get a chance to polish the diagram ahead of the group submission for the database portion of the course. Don't let perfection be the enemy as long as the agreed on elements are present and legible.

Refer to the GROUP conceptual model when working on your logical model HOMEWORK assignment.
