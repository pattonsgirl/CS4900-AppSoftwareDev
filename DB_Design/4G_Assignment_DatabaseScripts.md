# Group Assignment - Database Scripts

In your GROUP repository, in the folder called `Database`.

As a GROUP, commit two items to your GROUP repository:
- DB initialization script with all tables required for your DB
- docker-compose.yml file

If your / your GROUP CANNOT connect to and initialize your DB, you owe a post in MS Teams to @ Database Experts with troubleshooting you have done so far, links to your GROUP repo files, and anything else helpful you can offer.

Your GROUPs database submission will need to include a README file with how to initialize and continue running your database container.  It isn't due now, but a draft is recommended.

Your group will get a chance to polish the database initilization scripts ahead of the group submission for the database portion of the course.

Refer to the GROUP database initilization scripts when working on your database sql business queries HOMEWORK assignment.
