# Database Design - Assignment 3 - Physical Model

## Purpose / Objectives

- Apply knowledge / concepts from pre-requisite videos.
- Understand purpose and audience of the physical model.
- Understand basic physical model concepts.
- Create a physical model of your group project theme.
- Improve your physical model via peer-review critiques.
	- Review will be done in following class session and changes made when submitting Assignment 4

## Description

The intent is to learn about physical models and build one using your group projectâ€™s theme.

1. In your HOMEWORK repository, create a folder named `DatabaseDesign`, then create a file named `DB-Assignment-3.md`.
2. Watch the required videos or read the required articles (listed in the [3R_PreWork_PhysicalModel.md](3R_PreWork_PhysicalModel.md) file)
3. Write a description of the following common physical model components:
	- Key difference of the physical model compared to the conceptual and logical models
	- What are the common data types
	- Default values / Null values
	- Check constraints
4. Link to your GROUP logical model
5. Create a physical model for your group project theme.  Your physical model should refer to your GROUP logical model in your GROUP project repository.
	- This class will use MariaDB - since the physical model IS NOT platform agnostic, make sure to look up supported data types for MariaDB.
	- Recommended tools:
		- [DBDiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/d) comes highly recommended from Winsupply for devs who favor codifying instead of drawing boxes.
		- [Lucidcharts for ER Diagrams](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/landing/er-diagram-software)
		- [DB Schema](https://dbschema.com/)
6. Describe your physical model

In the 9/25 class session, your physical model will undergo your group peer review to collaborate and agree on a common group physical model to be used ahead of the next assignment due 9/30.
