# Database Design - Assignment 2 - Logical Model

## Purpose / Objectives

- Apply knowledge / concepts from pre-requisite videos.
- Understand purpose and audience of the logical model.
- Understand basic conceptual model terms.
- Create a logical model of your group project theme.
- Improve your logical model via peer-review critiques.
	- Review will be done in following class session and changes made when submitting Assignment 3

## Description

The intent is to learn about logical models and build one using your group projectâ€™s theme.

1. In your HOMEWORK repository, create a folder named `DatabaseDesign`, then create a file named `DB-Assignment-2.md`.
2. Watch the required videos or read the required articles (listed in the [2R_PreWork_LogicalModel.md](2R_PreWork_LogicalModel.md) file)
3. Write a description of the following common logical model terms:
	- Purpose of a logical model
	- Primary Key
	- Foreign Key
	- Relationships between entities
	- Normalization
4. Create a logical model for your group project theme
5. Describe your logical model

In the 9/23 class session, you will collaborate with your group to (hopefully) agree to a common logical model, which you will then use to design a physical model ahead of the class session on 9/25.

## Deliverable(s)

Submit to the assignment repository on GitHub.  Your file must include:

- Your updated conceptual diagram
- Define the following common logical model terms:
	- Purpose of a logical model
	- Primary Key
	- Foreign Key
	- Relationships between entities
	- Normalization
- Your logical model diagram using group project theme.  Your logical model should refer to your GROUP conceptual model in your GROUP project repository.
	- It is strongly recommend to start leaning into a DB design tool starting with your logical model.
		- [DBDiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/d) comes highly recommended from Winsupply for devs who favor codifying instead of drawing boxes.
		- [Lucidcharts for ER Diagrams](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/landing/er-diagram-software)
		- [DB Schema](https://dbschema.com/)
- Description of presented logical model
