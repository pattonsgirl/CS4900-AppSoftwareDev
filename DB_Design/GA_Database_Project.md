# Group Assignment - Database

In your GROUP project repository, assert all of the following requirements into a `DATABASE` folder. If these files exist external to the folder, migrate them to here.  You make create subfolders to further organize information / files

All documents must be updated to address feedback given for submissions. Ex - if you recieved physical model feedback that effects the conceptual model, redraw it.  If it effected the table intialization script, make sure the script reflects those changes.

Collaborate with your group members to finalize your GROUP submissions of the following documents:

- Model summary file containing (visually):
    - Conceptual model
        - may be handdrawn if the picture / scan is clean and legible, otherwise must be created in a diagramming / drawing software
    - Logical model
        - must be created in a diagramming / drawing software (handdrawn is not acceptable)
    - Physical model
        - **NOTE** include the "source code" exported to a file if you used a platform like `dbdiagram.io`
    - Label each model (headers recommended to break up document)
    - Include a description of each model
- Table initialization
    - DB initialization script with all tables required for your DB
        - **NOTE** where possible / logical, add 3-4 entries to your tables so that your team can have a base of data to begin with (and to run some basic queries)
    - docker-compose.yml file
    - `README.md` file with instructions of how to use `docker compose` to stand up your DB and how to connect to it with `DBeaver`
- Business questions & SQL queries
    - A file presenting 3-5 business questions & the SQL queries that will answer them from your database.
    - A minimum of one query shuld be something to display in a "dashboard" view of your applicaiton (think on the homepage)
- `README.md` file describing contents in the `DATABASE` folder.

## Rules of Contribution

Each team member must make *some* contribution to the GROUP repository for these required Database elements, as proved by their authorship in the commit history of the repository.  If a group member has no contributions, they will recieve a 0 grade for this portion of the group assignment - all other team members will recieve the score set in the feedback.

It is strongly recommended to have group memebers make PR requests of changes to documents via branches to start practicing ahead of the API unit.
