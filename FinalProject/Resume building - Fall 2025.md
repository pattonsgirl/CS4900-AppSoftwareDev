## How to use this Guide:

* Use only what you are comfortable talking about  
* Rephrase things to "familiar with” if you think you understood the concepts, but not the working parts  
* It’s okay in an interview to say you don’t know or something is beyond scope of what you did.  Use these as talking points to sell yourself\!  
* Differentiate whether you *implemented* or *collaborated* to create elements. If you indicate that you individually did tasks, your questions are going to be more intensive than if there is cushion phrasing like “worked as a group to…” or “collaborated to implement…”  
* Don’t forget to fork your project repository if desired (the original should never go away) & include a link in your resume to your project. 

## The tools:

* Version control / code collaboration: git / GitHub  
* Container tools: Docker Compose  
  * Docker Desktop UI  
  * Docker CLI  
* Database: MariaDB  
  * Query Tool: DBeaver  
* UX tools: Figma  
  * Concepts: Usability Heuristics, Gestalt Principles  
* Microservices tools: Enterprise Level Java, Spring Boot Framework  
  * Testing Tool: Bruno API Client  
* Frontend development: Node.js, Angular 18   
  * Node package management with NPM  
  * Angular CLI

- Achieved a full stack application from database to microservice to frontend  
- Collaborated with team members on developing and integrating segments of the application while operating in a simulated agile environment  
- Crafted user stories and business requirements to justify features of the application  
- Defined an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of application features   
- Created user flows for application features using Figma, gaining a deeper understanding of how UX fits into the product development lifecycle.  
- Evaluated and improved wireframes by applying Gestalt principles and Usability Heuristics, addressing usability issues to enhance the user experience.  
- Designed conceptual, logical, physical models for transactional database.  
- Implemented a transactional database with relational tables containing primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints.  
- Created a SQL Toolbox with SQL scripts to insert data for lookup tables and SQL queries to provide answers to various business questions.  
- Designed and implemented a RESTful Java Spring Boot microservice API that handles HTTP CRUD requests using JPA with properly implemented exception handling.

## Focused highlights

Use if pointing to a specific job that needs more highlighting of these specific skills

### Database

- Familiar with conceptual, logical, physical data models  
  - As homework, you did create these models.  If you are less confident, create a cushion and phrase it as “collaborated with the team to design…” or “familiar with…”.  
- Have a basic understanding of data normalization  
- Created relational tables (transactional, lookup) with primary keys, foreign keys, check constraints  
- Created a SQL Toolbox with SQL scripts to insert data for lookup tables and SQL queries to provide answers to various business questions.  
- Wrote SQL scripts to insert data for lookup tables  
- Wrote SQL scripts to query data to provide answers to business questions

### Angular

- Utilized HTTP client to achieve CRUD functionality with restful apis  
- Utilized single service principle and state representation to achieve clear, modular and efficient information communication between service to component to template to user  
- Familiar with RXJS library and asynchronous functionality in angular  
- Familiar with proper resource allocation and object management between service and component.   
- Utilized flexbox and other scss styles to format and display content to end users  
- Leveraged structural and attribute directives to achieve reactive content and styles within angular application

### Java Spring Boot

- Utilized the REST design pattern to handle HTTP requests.   
- Gracefully handled exceptions and returned responses in an expected format.  
- Implemented Entity Model relationships between MariaDB and a Spring Boot Application.   
- Utilized DTO pattern to remove JPA logic from the client responses to improve security.  
- Utilized MapStruct to implement mapper methods.  
- Performed database queries using JPA.   
- Implemented JPA validation for field constraints.
