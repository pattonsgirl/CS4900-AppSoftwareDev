## Homework 5 - Catch Up / Group Project Verification (again)

## Purpose / Objectives
> The purpose of this assignment is to ensure your group project is ready for the next unit and capable of handling GET, POST, and PUT requests.

## Cleanup

### Perform the following tasks in the Java service of your group repo:

### 1. Create a branch off of your `lastName-homework-5` branch and name the branch your last name and homework assignment number
Example: noel-homework-3

### 2. Implement remaining endpoints according to your API definitions document
- If there are endpoints on your api definition document that have not been implemented yet (and you already have at least one entity GET, POST, PUT working) - go ahead and do them
- If all of them are implemented - and everything is working great - get creative and come up with more functionality. You could do more endpoints, implement more error handling, write some unit tests.....
- Work with your team to decide how to approach this - whether each of you will implement a different endpoint of if you want to do the same ones and compare later

### 3. Ensure the project adheres to Java standards
- Packages are lowercase
- Class names are UpperCamelCase
- Method and variables are lowerCamelCase

### 4. Ensure code is properly formatted
- Use the `spotless` plugin to quickly and uniformly format your code

### 5. git add, commit, and push your changes to your branch upstream

## Group Project

### 1. Merge all final changes
This is it, guys. Make any final touches, implement any last minute functionality - whatever you need to make sure your project is ready for the front end!

### 2. Ensure proper architecture and code style
- Follow the steps in [Cleanup](#cleanup) for your group's default branch

### 3. Ensure changes are commited and pushed/merged to upstream default branch
