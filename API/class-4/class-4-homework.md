## Homework 4 - Creating PUT and POST methods

## Purpose / Objectives
> The purpose of this assignment is to create endpoints that allow you to add and update data from your group database using your newly initialized group Java project.

> You will individually create your own branch on your group repo to complete one portion of the assignment. You will get your individual grade on this. Then, as a group, you will work together to merge your branches into the main branch. You may make further adjustments as a group.

## Description

Choose ONE entity you want your service to add and update - use your API definitions document from homework-2 to help guide this decision. You will then create necessary controller methods to add and update this entity.
> Honors Students, you must choose TWO entities to add and update

If you are not honors but want to do multiple entities, feel free, but this assignment will be graded on getting just one entity working. Focus on that and then do extra if you want.

Coordinate with your team as you are choosing entities.

>_**The risk for merge conflicts is about to get significantly higher, so coordinate with your team or else be prepared to sort through things when it's time to merge to the default branch.**_

### Perform the following tasks in the Java service of your group repo:


### 1. Create a branch off of the default branch and name the branch your last name and homework assignment number
Example: noel-homework-4

### 2. Create a subdirectory under your project root `{your-service-name}/homework` called `{last-name}-homework-4`

### 3. Create PUT and POST methods in your Controller(s), and implement all supporting classes/methods

### 5. Create requests in Bruno to verify your new endpoints work
- Save clearly named screenshots of Bruno including the response, URL, request method, and response status code in `/homework/{last-name}-homework-4`
- There should be one screenshot per request

### 6. git add, commit, and push your changes to your branch upstream

# Rubric

Assignment score: X / 6 points (used for both individual and group)

-   `[ ]` Your Java service runs successfully
-   `[ ]` Controller methods are created for one entity to update and add (two entities for honors) (2pts)
-   `[ ]` Screenshot of all requests for new controller methods are saved in correct directory with 200 response status code, URL, response body, and request method visible (2pts)
-   `[ ]` Code is pushed to the repository with a clear commit message
