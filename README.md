### Office Hours

Access to module instructors (read section below) will be coordinated via Microsoft Teams (see access link in Course Information in Pilot).  The instructor of record will, frankly, be learning all of this too - utilize their office hours if you feel unable to productively interact with the module teams.

**Instructor of record office hours: TBD, otherwise by appointment in Russ 340.**  
    - Communications outside of office hours should be posted to the class Microsoft Teams channel.  

**Module instructor access: TBD.** Responses may not be immediate.  Posting to the correct module theme will get you the speediest help.  If you are unsure, post to the General channel. 
    - Screen share / synchronous sessions should be requested in advance to be respectful of schedules.
    - If you are going to send an **email**, email both module instructors and the course instructor.

## Course Description
Software development is a team activity where successful software is continually enhanced and refined to add value over time. Working in a team environment with other developers, quality assurance, product owners, and scrum masters is a skill needed for anyone entering or working in a corporate environment. This course will introduce and practice software development in a real world scenario. Students will begin with defining requirements, using agile methodology, then advance to create database designs, create functional UI/UX designs, create microservices, pushing code in a CI/CD pipeline, and create a front end web application. During the software development lifecycle you will practice merging and branching code, code reviews, and unit and performance tests. You will be partnered with software developers, database engineers, and IT leadership from a local Dayton company (Winsupply) for practical hands-on experience and mentorship.

## Student Learning Outcomes 
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:	
1. Demonstrate proficiency in the use of agile software development frameworks
2. Elicit business requirements, and design and implement a software solution that meets those requirements.
3. Demonstrate understanding of full-stack applications, including database, front-end user interface, and back end services elements.

## Pre-Requisites

CEG 2350 minimum grade of C **AND** CS 1181 minimum grade of C.

These prerequisites attempt to ensure familiarity with the command line, the basics of using git and GitHub, and competency with programming, code literacy, and basic data structures, although the course will not use Java as its primary programming language.  If you do not feel you meet competency in these areas, talk with your instructor early to consider if this course will be a good fit for you.

### Assignment Requirements

Unless otherwise specified in the assignment description, assignments are to be completed **individually**.  Students may collaborate on ideas and share resources.  Cite collaborations in code comments or commit messages.

### Honors Requirements

Students taking the course to satisfy the requirements of a university honors program will be given additional requirements for their assignments / group project.  To earn honors credit, students must earn an A or B for the overall course grade, and complete all extra honors requirements detailed in assignment / group project requirements. 

## Late work

Assignments are due by the due date posted.  Due to the pacing of this course, it is essential to complete assignments to the best of your ability within the time frame given. Late assignments will be accepted for feedback purposes only.  If you have a documented justification for needing an extension contact the course instructor.

## Academic Integrity

Discussion of course contents with other students is an important part of the academic process and is encouraged. However, it is expected that course assignments will be completed on an individual basis unless otherwise stated. If you work with other students on general concepts, be certain to acknowledge the collaboration and its extent in the assignment. Unacknowledged collaboration will be considered dishonest. Copying or significant collaboration on individual assignments will be considered a violation of the university guidelines for academic honesty. If the same work is turned in by two or more students for individual assignments, all parties involved may be held equally accountable for violation of academic integrity. You are responsible for ensuring that other students do not have access to your individual work.  If you suspect that your work has been compromised notify the course instructor immediately. Failure to attend the first day of class, where we will note this policy, does not excuse you from following these policies. If you have any questions about collaboration or any other issues related to academic integrity, please see the instructor immediately for clarification. 

In addition to the policy stated in this syllabus, students are expected to comply with the [Wright State University Code of Student Conduct](http://www.wright.edu/students/judicial/conduct.html), and in particular the portions pertaining to [Academic Integrity](http://www.wright.edu/students/judicial/integrity.html) at all times.

## Use of AI Tools

Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT, Midjourney, Co-pilot, etc.): You may not use AI to complete assignments unless stated otherwise by the instructor / module leaders.  For those assignments where AI tools are permitted, you must include a statement of what AI tools were used in the completion of the assignment, how they were used, and what portions of the assignment include material that was developed with the assistance of AI tools.  If you have any questions about whether or not use of a particular tool or technology is allowed, check with your instructor / module leaders first. 

In using AI tools, be aware that every assignment submission will be graded using the criteria provided in the assignment. Be aware that ChatGPT and other AI tools may not develop accurate or high-quality work that earns a passing grade. You will always be expected to check and verify AI-generated results for quality and accuracy. You will be graded on the work you turn in.

## Additional Needs

Students with disabilities or any additional needs are encouraged to set up an appointment with the course instructor at their earliest convenience to discuss any classroom accommodation that may be necessary.
