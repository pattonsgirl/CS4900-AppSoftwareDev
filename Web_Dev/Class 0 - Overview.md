## **⚙️ Class 0 — Setup & The Anatomy of a Modern Angular App**

### **Goal**

Set up a working development environment, understand the purpose of the Angular Command Line Interface (CLI), and dissect the structure of a modern, standalone-by-default Angular project.

### **Topics**

#### **Installing Node.js and npm**

The foundation of any modern web development environment is Node.js. It serves as a JavaScript runtime environment, allowing developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Bundled with Node.js is npm (Node Package Manager), the world's largest software registry. Npm is an essential tool for managing project dependencies—the external libraries and tools an application relies on.

Please install the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js from the official website:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### 

#### **What is a Package Manager?**

A package manager like npm automates the process of installing, updating, and managing the libraries (packages) a project needs. It reads a configuration file, package.json, which lists all dependencies. When a command like npm install is run, npm downloads the correct versions of these packages from its registry and places them in a `node_modules` folder within the project. This ensures that every developer working on the project has the exact same set of tools, creating a consistent and reproducible development environment.

#### 

#### **Installing the Angular CLI**

The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for initializing, developing, scaffolding, and maintaining Angular applications. It handles complex configuration and build processes, allowing developers to focus on writing code.

To install the CLI globally on a machine, students should open their terminal or command prompt and run:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

The `-g` flag signifies a global installation, making the ng command available anywhere on the system. As of Angular version 7, the major versions of the Angular core framework and the CLI are aligned, ensuring compatibility.

#### 

#### **Setting up the IDE (VSCode Recommended)**

A capable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is crucial for productivity. Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is highly recommended for Angular development due to its excellent TypeScript support and a rich ecosystem of extensions.

* **VSCode Download:** [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
* **Recommended Extension:** The official **Angular Language Service** extension provides code completion, navigation, and real-time error checking within templates, significantly improving the development experience.

#### 

#### **Generating the First Angular Project**

With the CLI installed, creating a new Angular application is a single command. Since Angular version 17, the CLI defaults to creating projects with the modern standalone architecture.

In the terminal, navigate to a desired directory and run:

```
ng new my-angular-app
```

The CLI will prompt for a few configuration choices:

1. **"Would you like to add Angular routing?"** — Select **Yes**. This sets up the necessary files for navigation.  
2. **"Which stylesheet format would you like to use?"** — Select **CSS**. This is the most straightforward option for beginners.

#### 

#### **Delving into the Modern Project Structure**

The project structure generated by the CLI is organized for clarity and scalability. The previous reliance on a monolithic app.module.ts has been replaced by a more decoupled and logical file structure that better separates concerns. This architectural improvement isolates responsibilities, making the application easier to understand and maintain.

**src/main.ts (The Application Entry Point):** This is the first file that executes. Its sole responsibility is to bootstrap, or launch, the application. It uses the bootstrapApplication function to start the root component (AppComponent). This is a significant departure from the legacy approach of bootstrapping an NgModule.

```ts
// src/main.ts
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { appConfig } from './app/app.config';
import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig)
.catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

**src/app/app.config.ts (Application-Level Configuration):** This file is the central hub for application-wide configuration, replacing the role previously held by the root `AppModule`. It is where services, such as the `router` or `HttpClient`, are made available to the entire application through an array of providers. This configuration is then passed to the `bootstrapApplication` function in [`main.ts`](http://main.ts).

```ts
// src/app/app.config.ts
import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core';
import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';
import { routes } from './app.routes';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers:
};
```

**src/app/app.routes.ts (Defining Navigation):** This file explicitly defines the application's navigation routes. Each route maps a URL path to a specific component. This array of routes is then imported into `app.config.ts` and provided to the application.

**src/app/app.component.ts (The Root Component):** This is the main component that acts as the container for the entire application. The key feature to note in its `@Component` decorator is standalone: true. This flag signifies that the component does not need to be declared in an NgModule and manages its own dependencies.

#### **Serving the App (ng serve)**

To compile and run the application, use the Angular CLI's `ng serve` command from within the project directory.

```
ng serve -o
```

The `-o` flag automatically opens the application in a new browser tab, typically at `http://localhost:4200`. The development server provides live reloading, meaning any saved changes to the source code will automatically trigger a rebuild and refresh the browser.

#### **A Brief Philosophical Overview**

Modern front-end development is about building interactive, dynamic user interfaces by breaking them down into small, reusable, and encapsulated pieces of code called **components**. Frameworks like Angular provide the structure, tools, and best practices to manage the complexity of these applications, handling everything from rendering the UI to managing application state and communicating with backend servers. The latest Angular methodologies focus on reducing boilerplate and making this process as simple and performant as possible.
