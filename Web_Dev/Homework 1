# Assignment 1 - HTML, CSS & Modern Templates

## Purpose / Objectives

> The purpose of this assignment is to practice the fundamentals of creating and extending a standalone Angular component. The skills being reinforced are:
> -   Generating components with the Angular CLI.
> -   Adding HTML structure and scoped CSS styling.
> -   Using the modern built-in `@for` and `@if` control flow syntax to render dynamic data.

## Description

Perform the following tasks in your course **homework** repository.

1.  Use the Angular CLI to generate a new standalone component relevant to your project's theme (e.g., `user-list`, `product-card`).
2.  Add the new component's selector to an existing component's template (like `app.component.html`) to make it visible on the page.
3.  In your new component's TypeScript file (`.ts`), create a property that holds an array of objects. Each object must have at least an `id` property and a `name` property.
4.  In the component's HTML file (`.html`), use a `@for` loop to iterate over your array and render a list item `<li>` for each object. You must use the mandatory `track` expression with each object's unique `id`.
5.  In the component's CSS file (`.css`), create a style class (e.g., adds a border or color) and apply it to the list items rendered by the `@for` loop.
6.  Use an `@if` block to display a message only when your data array has items in it.
7.  (Optional Stretch Goal) Add an `@empty` block to your `@for` loop that displays a message when the data array is empty.

## Deliverable(s)

Push your commits, including all files for the newly generated component (`.ts`, `.html`, `.css`) and any modified template files, to your course **homework** repository.
