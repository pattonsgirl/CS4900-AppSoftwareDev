# Homework 0 - Setup Verification

## Purpose / Objectives
> The purpose of this assignment is to ensure your development environment is working correctly by cloning, installing, and running an existing Angular project.
> You will also demonstrate basic interaction with the application by applying a filter to its data.

## Description

Perform the following tasks.

### 1. Clone the Mr Fix It UI Repository
1.  Clone the repository using the following command:
    `git clone https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/mr-fixit-ui.git`
2.  Open the cloned Mr Fix It UI project folder in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).

### 2. Install Dependencies
1.  Open an integrated terminal within your code editor (inside the project's root folder).
2.  Run the command `npm install` to download all necessary project dependencies.

### 3. Run the Application
1.  In the same terminal, run the command `ng serve` to compile the application and start the development server.

2.  Verify that the application is running in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:4200`.
3.  Make sure you are running the Mr Fix It DB && the Mr Fix It service.

### 4. Apply a Filter and Take Screenshot
1.  In the running application, navigate to the page that displays the work orders.
2.  Use the application's built-in UI to apply a filter to the list of work orders.
3.  Create a new branch in your GROUP UI repository named: `yourlastname-homework-0`.
4.  Create a folder named `homework0` on your branch, and then save a screenshot named `yourlastname-hw0.png` (any image format is allowed) of your browser running the Mr. Fix It UI application, showing the applied filter and the resulting filtered list of work orders.

### 5. Setup GROUP UI Repository

1.  Create & clone your GROUP UI repository (see link in Pilot -> Course Info)
2.  Have **one** group member initialize the Angular project for UI development with `ng new app-name` and push it to the default branch of your GROUP UI repository
    - [Reference the Clone the Course Repository OR Create New Project of Overview 0](https://github.com/pattonsgirl/CS4900-AppSoftwareDev/blob/main/Web_Dev/Class%200%20-%20Overview.md#two-paths-clone-the-course-repository-or-create-new-project)
3. Have all group members pull the change and confirm they can run the default Angular app.  Your group will now be ready for the coming homeworks!

> As with your API / service we recommend having your app be in the root directory of the repsository (not a subdirectory) to simplify the need to remember pathing tricks.
