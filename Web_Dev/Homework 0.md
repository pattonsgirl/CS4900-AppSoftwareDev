# Assignment 0 - Setup Verification

## Purpose / Objectives
> The purpose of this assignment is to ensure your development environment is working correctly by cloning, installing, and running an existing Angular project. You will also demonstrate basic interaction with the application by applying a filter to its data.

## Description

Perform the following tasks.

### 1. Clone the Course Repository
1.  In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you store your projects.
2.  Create & clone your GROUP UI repository (see link in Pilot -> Course Info)
2.  Clone the repository using the following command:
    `git clone https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/mr-fixit-ui.git`
3.  Open the cloned Mr Fix It UI project folder in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).

### 2. Install Dependencies
1.  Open an integrated terminal within your code editor (inside the project's root folder).
2.  Run the command `npm install` to download all necessary project dependencies.

### 3. Run the Application
1.  In the same terminal, run the command `ng serve` to compile the application and start the development server.
2.  Verify that the application is running in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:4200`.
3.  Make sure you are running the Mr Fix It DB && the Mr Fix It service.

### 4. Apply a Filter and Take Screenshot
1.  In the running application, navigate to the page that displays the work orders.
2.  Use the application's built-in UI to apply a filter to the list of work orders.
3.  Create a new branch in your GROUP UI repository named: `yourlastname-homework-0`.
4.  Create a folder named `homework0` on your branch, and then save a screenshot named `yourlastname-hw0.png` (any image format is allowed) of your browser running the Mr. Fix It UI application, showing the applied filter and the resulting filtered list of work orders.
