# Assignment 0 - Setup Verification

## Purpose / Objectives
> The purpose of this assignment is to ensure your development environment is working correctly by cloning, installing, and running an existing Angular project. You will also demonstrate basic interaction with the application by applying a filter to its data.

## Description

Perform the following tasks.

### 1. Clone the Course Repository
1.  In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you store your projects.
2.  Clone the repository using the following command:
    `git clone https://github.com/pattonsgirl/CS4900-AppSoftwareDev.git`
3.  Open the cloned `CS4900-AppSoftwareDev` folder in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).

### 2. Install Dependencies
1.  Open an integrated terminal within your code editor (inside the project's root folder).
2.  Run the command `npm install` to download all necessary project dependencies.

### 3. Run the Application
1.  In the same terminal, run the command `ng serve` to compile the application and start the development server.
2.  Verify that the application is running in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:4200`.

### 4. Apply a Filter and Take Screenshot
1.  In the running application, navigate to the page that displays the work orders.
2.  Use the application's built-in UI to apply a filter to the list of work orders.
3.  Create a new folder in the project: `/homework/homework-0/`.
4.  Save a clearly named screenshot of your browser, showing the applied filter and the resulting filtered list of work orders, in the `/homework/homework-0/` directory.

### 5. git add, commit, and push your changes
1.  Use `git` to add, commit, and push your new screenshot file to your repository.
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m "feat: add screenshot for assignment 0"`
    - `git push`
