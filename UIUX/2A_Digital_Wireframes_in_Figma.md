### **Assignment 2 – Digital Wireframes in Figma**

**Purpose / Objectives**

* Reinforce UX workflow: from flow to wireframe

* Practice low-fidelity interface design

* Translate hand-drawn work into digital form

**Description**  
 Perform the following tasks in your course homework repository:

* Each person chooses one of the three Bri gives you and completes the assignment individually, each for a different idea.   
* Use Figma to create low-fidelity wireframes of the 3 user flows you sketched in class

* Include at least 2 screens per flow (4 total minimum)

* Use basic shapes, labels, and layout; no color or styling yet

* Create a separate page or frame for each user flow

* Add short notes to indicate what the user is doing on each screen

**DURING CLASS**  
 You will share your screens with a peer group and get early feedback. 

**DURING THE NEXT CLASS**

Your User Flows and Wireframes need to be completed for the next class. They don’t have to be in Figma, but they should be able to be presented to the class. The FINAL draft should be in Figma. 

**Deliverable(s)**

* Figma file (shared link)  
* Push a markdown file with the link and a 1–2 sentence summary of your design decisions  
* Submit the FINAL wireframes (1 week from date of assignment)
