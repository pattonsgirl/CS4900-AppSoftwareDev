**Agenda**  
Intro to UX (20 min)

Workshop (40 min)

**Expectations:** Students will review materials/resources beforehand. During class, we will discuss the topic, address any questions, and then begin working on the homework.

**Workshop:** For this class, students will create user flows and wireframes. The expectation is that students will create multiple drafts using pen and paper and then use Figma to create a polished version. 

**During Class:** Students will work on user flows and wireframes, each with a unique idea.  

**Assignment:** User Flows \+ Wireframes (full day/workshop)

* Consider reviewing your competitors' webpages for commonly used UI patterns or researching UI patterns.   
* Use a pencil and paper to create the three most important user flows detailing how a user will navigate from screen to screen.  
* Each flow should be a task in your application. For example, create an account or adopt a pet.  
* Create wireframes for each page identified in the user flows. Be sure to identify how a user will get from one page to the next. 

**For Next Class**

* Review the materials and resources.  
* Complete wireframes on paper and be prepared to share with the class.
