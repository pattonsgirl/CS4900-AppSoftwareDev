**Assignment:** User Flows \+ Wireframes (full day/workshop)

* Consider reviewing your competitors' webpages for commonly used UI patterns or researching UI patterns.   
* Use a pencil and paper to create the three most important user flows detailing how a user will navigate from screen to screen.  
* Each flow should be a task in your application. For example, create an account or adopt a pet.  
* Create wireframes for each page identified in the user flows. Be sure to identify how a user will get from one page to the next.
