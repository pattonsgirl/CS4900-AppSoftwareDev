### **Assignment 3.1 – Heuristic Evaluation & Revisions**

**Purpose / Objectives**

* Practice heuristic evaluation using Nielsen's principles

* Apply feedback to improve UX wireframes

**Description**  
Your GROUP now the project proposal packet in your GitHub GROUP repository (or handed out as paper copies on 9/11)

Among your team mates, determine a wireframe (keeping in mind a user flow - what is the intedend user action for that pages).  

You recieved an invitation to join the educational Figma team. Through this invite, you will see a collection of project boards for all teams. Within the teams, there is a page with your last name.  I recommend editing this page title with your last name followed by the wireframe theme you are working on - "dashboard of...", "add a ..." "edit a..."

Perform the following tasks in your course homework repository OR by leaving comments in your Figma page:

* Create a wireframe in Figma based on a user flow for the GROUP project proposal.  It is recommended to make a first draft, then do the following steps to deeply evaluate your design.

* Use the heuristic evaluation checklist from class to evaluate your wireframe.
    * [Heuristic evaluation checklist](https://media.nngroup.com/media/articles/attachments/Heuristic_Evaluation_Workbook_1_Fillable.pdf)

* Identify at least 3 issues and propose how to fix them.

* Write a 2–3 sentence description / short series of comments as notes of what you changed and why.

**DURING CLASS**  
You’ll give and receive feedback on your wireframes using heuristics in pairs.

**Deliverable(s)**

* Link to Figma wireframes in your GitHub HOMEWORK repo to provide yourself a quick reference
    - The UI / UX team already has view access - links and document expectations will be posted after your in class session evaluating your wireframes and an opportunity for revisions

* Markdown file / comments on Figma with changes described based on heuristic evaluations
