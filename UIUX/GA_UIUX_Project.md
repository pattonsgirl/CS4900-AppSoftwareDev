# Group Assignment - UI UX

In your GROUP project repository, you will already have your Project Planning Guide.

Make a UIUX folder in your GROUP project repository.

To keep things organized in Figma, a suggestion is to start using GROUPNAME - USERFLOWACTION for pages.  This may help your team differentiate finalized elements from homework-oriented drafts.

Utilize Figma to make professional presentations of the documents below. You must now have them presented and visible within your repository - you may still link back to the Figma files for quick reference internally to the team.

Collaborate with your group members to finalize your GROUP submissions of the following documents:

- Wireframes
    - There should be a minimum of one user flow and a set of accompanying wireframes for each member of your group
        - 4 group members = 4 user flows = 2 wireframes per flow = 8 wireframes
    - There is an expectation of two wireframes per flow - this should be based on how many views a user would interact with to complete the action
        - For example, one user flow could be “as a user, I want to add a new card to my inventory database.”  This would be associated with two frames - an add cards frame and perhaps a confirmation message or updated list view or from what view they would access the add cards feature.

- Brand Guide
    - 1-2 primary colors
    - 4 Accent Colors
    - 4 gray or neutral colors
    - H1 - H5 fonts
    - Body and inline link fonts
    - A primary, secondary button, and an inline button

- Optional (Required for Honors)
    - Iconography - https://fonts.google.com/icons - You can customize the icons to fit your style.
    - Wordmark

Create a `README.md` file in your group's UIUX repository: 
- Describe the contents / organization of your documents or image embeds
- Add any notes you feel would provide additional context
- Sufficient documentation must include descriptions of what the different wireframes focus on - which user flow/ action they pair with
- For your brand guide you must include notes on tone or personality (1–2 bullet points)

## Tips

- **Draft ideas on paper** and then work in Figma. Get feedback on your ideas on paper and see if they’re easy to understand before putting in a lot of work in Figma. It’s easier to edit or redraft on paper and pencil.
- Watch this ****Figma for beginners tutorial**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4NyQ5iOMF0 
- Try to **improve from your initial wireframes**. These final wireframes should be more detailed and organized.
- Take advantage of the pre-made **frames in Figma that represent monitor sizes**.
- Try to **use accurate scale and proportions for the elements in your designs**. You can use screenshots of existing web apps to get a better understanding of sizing.
- **Consider the hierarchy** within your designs. How are you visually guiding the user through the page and through the task at hand?
- **Consider the usability heuristics** and evaluate your designs with them. Specifically, consider how the user is getting feedback for their task at hand. 
- **Use arrows and text to explain** how the user moves through the user task.
- **Share your wireframes with a roommate or friend** and see if they can understand them and how they would be expected to interact with your interface. 
- You can **search Figma Community for wireframing kits**. These are pre-made components like buttons, cards, and navigation that you can copy and paste into your designs. This will save you a lot of time!
- Consider **applying your brand guide to a representative screen** to check that your brand guide is working in practice. This can also help your team get on the same page when you move into development.

## Rules of Contribution

Each team member must make *some* contribution to the GROUP repository for thee required UI / UX elements, as proved by their authorship in the commit history of the repository.  If a group member has no contributions, they will recieve a 0 grade for this portion of the group assignment - all other team members will recieve the score set in the feedback.
