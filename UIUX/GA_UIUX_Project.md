# Group Assignment - UI UX

In your GROUP project repository, you will already have your Project Planning Guide.

Make a UIUX folder in your GROUP project repository.

Collaborate with your group members to finalize your submissions of the following documents:

- Wireframes
    - There should be a *minimum* of one wireframe for each member of your group
        - 4 group members = 4 wireframes
- Brand guide
    - 2–3 color swatches with hex codes
    - 1–2 font selections for headings and body text
    - A wordmark or basic symbol/logo idea
    - Notes on tone or personality (1–2 bullet points)

Utilize Figma to make professional presentations of these documents.  You must now have them presented and visible with your repository - you may still link back to the Figma files for quick reference internally to the team.

Create a `README.md` file in your group's UIUX repository that describes the contents and adds any notes you feel would provide additional context. Sufficient documentation must include descriptions of what the different wireframes focus on - which user flow / action they pair with.

## Rules of Contribution

Each team member must make *some* contribution to the GROUP repository, as proved by their authorship in the commit history of the repository.  If a group member has no contributions, they will recieve a 0 grade for this portion of the group assignment - all other team members will recieve the score determined in the feedback.
